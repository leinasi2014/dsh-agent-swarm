This repository is a product and architecture reference, not a DSH dependency.
Use it to study orchestration requirements, state transitions, isolation,
budgets, memory, skill evolution, permissions and distributed failure cases.
Translate those requirements onto existing DSH services and lifecycle seams.

Do not copy JiuwenSwarm's Python Runtime, persistence schema, transport choices
or public types into the DSH plugin contract. When a Jiuwen concept conflicts
with the target DSH installation, the installed DSH exports and official DSH
source are authoritative.

The pinned tree contains Git LFS videos. They are deliberately left as pointer
files because the text source is sufficient for development analysis and some
upstream media objects are unavailable.
